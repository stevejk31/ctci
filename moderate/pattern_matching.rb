# You are given two strings, pattern and value. The pattern string consists of
# just the letters of a and b, describing a pattern within a string. For example,
# the string catcatgocatgo matches the pattern aabab(where cat is a and go is b).
# It also matches patterns like a, ab, and b. Write a method ot determine if a
# value matches pattern.
